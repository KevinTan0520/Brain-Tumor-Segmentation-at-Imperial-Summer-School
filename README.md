train.py trains model using the dataset. 

test.py runs the model on certain testcase and predicts the result without comparing it to the actual condition. 

compare.py runs the model on certain testcase and provides results (e.g. dice & accuracy) and visualise the result and ground truth on a picture.

run_all _tests.py runs the model on a dataset, basically running compare.py multiple times. 

calc.py summarises the statistic results generated by run_all_test.py and visualise them. 

The TXT files shows some of the commands about how to run the python files.
